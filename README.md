# 📡 5G Signal Coverage Simulation
### 📖 Project Overview

Understanding signal coverage is essential for optimizing tower placement and ensuring reliable connectivity in modern wireless networks. This project simulates and visualizes the signal strength of a 5G tower using a path loss model and generates a coverage heatmap to analyze signal distribution over a geographic area.

### 🎯 Objectives

Model the path loss of a 5G signal using the COST-Hata propagation model
Simulate received signal strength over a grid surrounding a base station
Visualize signal coverage using a heatmap
Demonstrate the use of Python for network simulation and data visualization

### Tools used
Python 3.x – Core programming language
NumPy – Numerical computations and array operations
Matplotlib – Visualization and plotting 

### Output
A 2D coverage heatmap showing signal strength distribution
Clear visualization of strong and weak signal regions
Insight into how distance impacts 5G signal propagation
